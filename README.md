### MIT COVID-19 DATATHON

This repository contains our teamwork on MIT Covid-19 Datathon Presentation.

Our project is also featured on MIT COVID-19 DATATHON webpage: https://covid19challenge.mit.edu/datathon/ (Track-D Team-9)

Our research focuses on **Epidemiology topic**. 

#### What are the protective factors that increase the chance of recovery:

#### a)	from asymptotic Covid-19,

#### b)	after hospital admission due to Covid-19,

#### c)	and survival after admission to ICU and/or mechanical ventilator?

#### Our Objective:

To analyze of impacts of major risk factor (Comorbidities) vs top protective factors on recovery

In this repository: 

1.	For outline of our approach and analysis, please refer to **TrackD-Team9-Final.pptx**

2.	For end-to-end process, please refer to **MITCovid19_stats+data_analysis.ipynb**

#### Our entire workflow:

a)	Data Gathering,

b)	Data Cleaning and Processing,

c)	Feature Mapping,

d)	Convert Numerical Variables into Categorical,

e)	Aggregation Method (extensively used for comparison of factorsâ€™ impacts on recovery),

f)	Statistical Test (T-Test and P-Value, for confirmation of our impact analysis)

It was such an amazing learning experience to collaborate with professionals from diverse backgrounds and fight against Covid-19 with Data Science applications.
